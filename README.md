## Goals

  * Spin up a linux VPS (Virtual Private Server) that will run our containerized API and DB for local development. 
  * SSH into our VPS.
  * Clone our API Repository (using SSH). We will use an actual API repository from an EdTech SaaS that John and Jordan have been working on.
  * Install docker engine and docker compose.
  * Install Google Cloud SDK.
  * Install PostgreSQL client tools.
  * Install all required tooling on our VPS.
  * Demonstrate how VS Code can be used to [open a folder on our VPS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) and develop against our API.
